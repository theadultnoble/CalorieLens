## Key Features

### Core Features (v1)

1. **Image Recognition for Ingredient Identification**

   - Users can take or upload a photo of a prepared dish, and the app identifies the ingredients using advanced image recognition technology.
   - Provides a list of detected ingredients (e.g., chicken, rice, spinach).

2. **Quantity Estimation and Nutritional Breakdown**

   - Estimates ingredient quantities (with optional user correction) and calculates individual calorie counts.
   - Displays a detailed breakdown of calories, macronutrients (proteins, carbs, fats), and optional micronutrients.

3. **Total Calorie Calculation**

   - Sums the calories of all identified ingredients to provide the total calorie count of the dish.
   - Supports complex dishes with multiple components.

4. **Manual Ingredient Input and Database**

   - Users can manually input and save their favorite or regularly used ingredients (e.g., quinoa, kale) into a personal database.
   - Stored locally and synced to the cloud for accessibility.

5. **AI-Powered Recipe Creation**

   - Generates recipes using the user’s saved ingredients, tailored to a specific calorie goal (e.g., 500 calories per serving).
   - Ensures culinary compatibility and variety, powered by artificial intelligence.

6. **Meal Saving and Tracking**

   - Users can save analyzed dishes or generated recipes to a log for daily or weekly tracking.
   - Displays historical data in a simple, digestible format.

7. **Simple and Intuitive UI**

   - Clean, step-by-step interface: upload photo > review results > save or adjust.
   - Designed for ease of use across all skill levels.

8. **Privacy and Security**
   - Encrypts user data and photos, with transparent privacy policies and secure cloud storage.

### Planned Features (v2)

- **Meal Planning Suggestions**: AI-generated weekly meal plans based on saved ingredients and calorie goals.
- **Voice Interaction**: Optional hands-free commands (e.g., “Suggest a 400-calorie recipe”) with text fallback.

## App Architecture

### Overview

CalorieSnap uses a **modular, client-server architecture** to balance performance, scalability, and development efficiency. The frontend is built with Expo React Native, while the backend handles complex processing and data management.

### Layers

1. **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**

   - Displays UI and handles user interactions.
   - _Technologies_: Expo React Native, React Navigation, React Native Elements.

2. **Application Layer (Frontend + Backend)**

   - Manages state, workflows, and API communication.
   - _Technologies_: Context API (state), REST API (communication).

3. **Service Layer (Backend)**

   - Processes image recognition, AI recipe generation, and nutritional lookups.
   - _Technologies_: Node.js + Express, Google Cloud Vision, TensorFlow.js.

4. **Data Layer (Backend + Local)**
   - Stores user data and integrates external nutritional sources.
   - _Technologies_: Firebase Firestore, AsyncStorage, USDA FoodData Central API.

- **Local Storage**: AsyncStorage
- **Image Handling**: Expo ImagePicker

### Backend

- **Server**: Node.js with Express
- **Hosting**: AWS Lambda (serverless, scalable)
- **API**: REST API

### AI and Image Processing

- **Image Recognition**: Google Cloud Vision API
- **Recipe Generation**: TensorFlow.js (custom model) or OpenAI API
- **Nutritional Data**: USDA FoodData Central API

## User Workflow

1. **Analyze a Dish**:
   - User takes/uploads a photo → Backend identifies ingredients → Displays calorie breakdown → User saves (optional).
2. **Create a Recipe**:
   - User selects saved ingredients and calorie goal → AI generates recipe → User reviews and saves.
3. **Track Meals**:
   - User logs analyzed dishes or recipes → Views daily/weekly totals.

---

## Development Considerations

- **Expo Workflow**: Managed workflow to avoid native code complexity; offload AI/image processing to backend.
- **Scalability**: Start with serverless hosting and Firebase; scale to dedicated servers if needed.
- **Performance**: Keep frontend lightweight; rely on backend for heavy computations.

## Value Proposition

CalorieSnap empowers users to understand and control their nutrition effortlessly. Whether analyzing a home-cooked meal, crafting a calorie-specific recipe, or tracking intake over time, the app combines powerful AI technology with a simple, intuitive design. Built with Expo React Native, it’s poised for iOS excellence and future Android expansion, delivering a versatile tool for health-conscious food lovers.
